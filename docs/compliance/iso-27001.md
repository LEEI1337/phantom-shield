# NSS v3.1.1 -- ISO 27001 Alignment

[Back to Main Documentation](../README.md) | [Full White Paper](../white-paper/NSS-v3.1.1-Enterprise-White-Paper.md)

---

## Overview

NSS v3.1.1 has been evaluated against ISO/IEC 27001:2022 (Information Security Management) controls. The system achieves a strong alignment across all evaluated Annex A controls.

**Overall Maturity: 4.1 / 5**

Maturity levels follow a 1--5 scale:
- **Level 1:** Initial / Ad-hoc
- **Level 2:** Repeatable
- **Level 3:** Defined
- **Level 4:** Managed and Measurable
- **Level 5:** Optimized

## Control Alignment Matrix

| ISO 27001 Control | Description | NSS Implementation | Maturity Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A.5: Policies** | Information security policies | Policy Engine (OPA) + comprehensive documentation | Level 4 |
| **A.6: Organization** | Organization of information security | RBAC + Governance Plane | Level 4 |
| **A.7: Human Resources** | Human resource security | Access Control + Audit logging | Level 3 |
| **A.8: Asset Management** | Asset management | Inventory tracking + encryption | Level 4 |
| **A.9: Access Control** | Access control | Zero Trust architecture + MFA support | Level 4 |
| **A.10: Cryptography** | Cryptographic controls | AES-256-GCM + TLS 1.3 | Level 5 |
| **A.11: Physical/Logical Security** | Physical and environmental security | Loopback isolation + network segmentation | Level 4 |
| **A.12: Operations Security** | Operations security | Monitoring + alerting + automated responses | Level 4 |
| **A.13: Communications Security** | Communications security | TLS 1.3 + HMAC request signing | Level 4 |
| **A.14: System Acquisition** | System acquisition, development, and maintenance | Infrastructure as Code | Level 4 |

## Detailed Notes

### A.5: Policies (Level 4)

The OPA-based Policy Engine enforces security policies as code. All policies are version-controlled, auditable, and automatically enforced at runtime through the Governance Plane.

### A.9: Access Control (Level 4)

NSS implements a Zero Trust model where every request must be authenticated and authorized. RBAC is enforced through VIGIL, and all API access requires HMAC-SHA256 signed requests with short-lived JWTs.

### A.10: Cryptography (Level 5)

This is the highest-maturity control. NSS uses AES-256-GCM for data at rest (via SAG encryption in the Knowledge Fabric) and TLS 1.3 for all data in transit. This represents optimized, industry-leading cryptographic practices.

### A.11: Physical/Logical Security (Level 4)

All internal services are bound to the loopback interface, creating an air-gapped logical network. Only Port 11337 (Cognitive Gateway) is accessible, and even that is blocked by default with explicit firewall allowlisting required.

### A.12: Operations Security (Level 4)

The Governance Plane provides real-time monitoring and automated alerting. Guardian Shield logs all security decisions. Metrics are collected on Port 11340 for integration with enterprise monitoring stacks.

## Maturity Summary

| Maturity Level | Controls |
|---|---|
| Level 5 (Optimized) | A.10 Cryptography |
| Level 4 (Managed) | A.5, A.6, A.8, A.9, A.11, A.12, A.13, A.14 |
| Level 3 (Defined) | A.7 |

**Average: 4.1 / 5**
